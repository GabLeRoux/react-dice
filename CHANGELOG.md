## 1.0.1
* 1.0.0 release's component's roll button did not work. This has been resolved

## 1.0.0
* Near complete rewrite
* Exported components replaced with a singular `<Dice />` component with an updated API.
* Logic functions renamed for both clarity and brevity.
* Styles added to contain `dice` component, it now behaves as an `inline-block` element.
* Readme completely rewritten to reflect changes.

## 0.1.0
* Add Changelog
* Add results array to SimpleDie and StaticRoll, which are turned off by default
* `DiceLogic` returns a `resultsArr` by default.
* styles added to shrink SimpleDie to a more appropriate size
* maximum or minimum roles now have unique styles
* removed standardDice, as they added too little value

This is the first major update, which moves this into a more useful tool. With this update, the results arrays are now accessible through the components, and we move towards having information conveyed through the styles, which will be expanded upon throughout 0.1.

## 0.0.3
* Fix error in logic for `<SimpleDie />`

## 0.0.2
* Add readme file
* Dice logic tidied up to add increased consistency/usability.

## 0.0.1
* First Version, basic implementations of dice components and logic.
